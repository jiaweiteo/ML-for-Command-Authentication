# ADSC Internship: Midterm Progress

## Introduction

This repository contains all the files used during my internship with ADSC. This main folder contains my current works on dataset generation and ML implementation for malicious command injection. Most of the files are created by Jia Wei (with some parts created by Sean Gunawan)

## Python Requirements

To install Python prerequisites for all the handover files you may wish to run this command:

    python -m pip install numpy scikit-learn pandapower jupyter tensorflow pymodbus[tornado] twisted

This should cover most if not all 3rd party libraries needed.

## Directory Structure

- datasets folder: folder containing .py files for datasets generation and training and testing dataset folders
- ml_models folder: folder containing .py and .ipynb files for ML models implementation and contains miscellaneous files detailing the ML model results
- readme_img: Contains images for the different README.md
- miscellaneous: Contains .pptx/.pdf/.txt for dataset generation pseudocode, dataset generation summary, ML results and midterm report
